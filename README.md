This is my homework for the interview problem.
In the repo, there are four files that are not part of the solution:
1. README.md, which is this file.
2. REQUIREMENT.md, which is an instruction to setup the proper environment to run the test.
3. Brainstorm.md, which is a file explaining my thinking process during the process.
4. Automation_test_Project.docx, the handout.
